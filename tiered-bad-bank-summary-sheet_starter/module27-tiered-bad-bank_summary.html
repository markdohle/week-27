    <h2 id="local-state">Local State</h2>
        <p>
          "State" refers to changes in your program based on user input or interaction. 
           An example of state changing would be when a user submits a login form that clears the form fields upon submission. 
        </p>

    <h2 id="converting-components-to-react">Converting Components to React</h2>
        <p>
          Refactoring your plain JavaScript code so that a frontend framework
          like React can abstract it can to save you time. This is why you had to do it in 
          the Bad Bank exercise.  Here are the necessary steps: 
        </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Routing </li>
            <li>State management</li>
            <li>Data binding</li>
          </ul>

        <h2 id="routing-in-react">Routing in React</h2>
        <p>
          In the past, you may have routed your applications using &#39;onClick&#39; events, moving from page to page 
          when a user clicked a particular link. However, the browser doesn't automatically 
          remember what page the user has come from, so simple functionality like navigating with a back button is not possible. 
          Now, you can use HashRouter and React to create routes and manage browser states. 
          For more information, refer to the <a href="https://reactrouter.com/web/api/HashRouter">HashRouter documentation.</a> 
        </p>

        <h2 id="node-server">Node Server</h2>
        <p>
          A Node server allows you to serve files through an external router such as Express using the HTTP protocol. 
          It allows interaction between your files and those of the users. When users interact with your website on the 
          front end, it makes sure that your database is updated. Also, it ensures that 
          data is retrieved from the database and displayed to the users. 
        </p>

        <h2 id="database-types">Database Types</h2>
        <p>
          There are several types of databases to choose from. This module, we will examine relational databases
          and document-style databases. Relational databases store an object's data in separate tables, 
          while document-style databases store all the data for a given object in one database instance, using a 
          format similar to a JavaScript object. 
        </p>
        <h2 id="mongodb">MongoDB</h2>
        <p>
          MongoDB is the document-style database that was used in the Bad Bank exercise. Like other document databases, 
          MongoDB uses JSON-like documents called &quot;BSON&quot; (binary representation of JSON objects) with 
          optional database schemas. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is an example of a MongoDB data point in a database: 
        </p>
        <pre><code class="lang-js">
          var mydoc = {
            <span class="hljs-symbol">_id:</span> ObjectId(<span class="hljs-string">"5099803df3f4948bd2f98391"</span>),
            <span class="hljs-symbol">name:</span> { <span class="hljs-string">first:</span> <span class="hljs-string">"Alan"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">last:</span> <span class="hljs-string">"Turing"</span> },
            <span class="hljs-symbol">birth:</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> Date(<span class="hljs-string">'Jun 23, 1912'</span>),
            <span class="hljs-symbol">death:</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> Date(<span class="hljs-string">'Jun 07, 1954'</span>),
            <span class="hljs-symbol">contributions:</span> [ <span class="hljs-string">"Turing machine"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"Turing test"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"Turingery"</span> ],
            <span class="hljs-string">views :</span> NumberLong(<span class="hljs-number">1250000</span>)
          }
          </code></pre>

          <p>
            Here are some self-study questions that can help you better understand the concepts
            covered this module:
          </p>
            <ul>
            <li>What is a data store?</li>
            <li>What is context?</li>
            <li>How does the request/response cycle work?</li>
            <li>What is a route?</li>
            <li>What is authentication? </li>
            <li>What are promises, and how do they work?</li>
            </ul>
